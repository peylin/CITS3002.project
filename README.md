CITS3002: Practical Project 2018 

The aim of the project is to develop a network-based application to test students through their ability to
correctly answer multi-choice questions and to complete short programming challenges written in one of Java, C, C+, or Python. Authenticated students interact with the testing system using a standard web-browser.
